# Make Emacs temp buffers inherit buffer-local environment variables

There's a fairly common pitfall when Emacs libraries run background
processes on behalf of a user: the library should honour any
environment variables set buffer-locally, but many such libraries run
processes in temporary buffers that do not inherit the calling
buffer's environment.

An example is the Emacs built-in command
`shell-command-to-string`. Whatever buffer-local `process-environment`
(or `exec-path`) the user has set, that command will always use the
Emacs-wide default. This is *specified* behaviour, but not *expected*
or *helpful*, particularly if one uses a library like
[envrc](https://github.com/purcell/envrc) with `direnv`.

`inheritenv` provides a couple of tools for dealing with this
issue:

1. Library authors can wrap code that plans to execute processes in
   temporary buffers with the `inheritenv` macro.
2. Users can modify commands like `shell-command-to-string` using the
   `inheritenv-add-advice` macro.

## Installation

### Manual

Ensure `inheritenv.el` is in a directory on your load-path, and add
the following to your `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

```elisp
(require 'inheritenv)
```

### MELPA

If you're an Emacs 24 user or you have a recent version of
`package.el` you can install `inheritenv` from the
[MELPA](http://melpa.org) repository. The version of
`inheritenv` there will always be up-to-date.
